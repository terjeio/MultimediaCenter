MAYA Huracan PreAmp MK III Rev. A by

Licensed under CERN OHL v.1.2 or later except the RIAA-circuitry which I believe is public domain.

The RIAA-circuitry was published by now defunct danish magazine High Fidelity way back in the 1980's.
I no longer have a copy of the issue(s) related to the design so I am not sure about any related copyright
but it surely is available for non-commercial use.

NOTE: Rev A has not yet been been verified as a working design.

Firmware will be released as a separate package under a different license after the design is verified.

A limited number of PCBs might or might not be made available for purchase at cost.

Files are in KiCad format.
