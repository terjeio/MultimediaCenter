# PreAmpBoard firmware

Firmware code is in a [separate project](https://github.com/terjeio/PreAmpBoardFirmware/) since it seems to me Git does not allow cloning of subfolders in a project. Also, it is convenient to be able to import the code straight into TIs cloud based IDE for compilation and upload.
